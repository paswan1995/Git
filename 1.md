# Version Control Systems


*  Repository maintains the history i.e. who has changed and what got changed and also maintains versions

*  Version Control Systems are of majorly Two architectural models

* Client Server: Examples (Subversion, TFVC, Clearcase,…)

* Distributed: Examples (Mercurial, Git)
 

Git
----

* In Git every system will have a copy of repository
* The Philosiphy of Git is as follows

Terms
-----

* Artifact: Result of build, but generally refers to the package

* Code Repository: This means we use this to store code and its history

* Artifact Repository: This refers to artifcats and its versions

Exercise
--------

* Try to find what hashing is and why do we use it ?

* What is Hashing in Git?
    * In Git, hashing is a way to create a unique identifier for each change (or commit) you make to your code. This identifier is a long string of letters and numbers, usually 40 characters long, created using a special algorithm called SHA-1.
       
       * Unique ID: Each commit has its own unique hash. Think of it like a fingerprint for that specific change.
       
       * Data Integrity: If you change even a tiny part of the code, the hash will change completely. This helps Git know if something has been altered or corrupted.

       * History Tracking: You can use the hash to find any commit in your project’s history. It helps you see what changes were made, by whom, and when.

* Why Do We Use Hashing in Git?
    * Hashing serves several important purposes in Git:
   
Check for Changes
--------------------
  * Hashes help ensure that your code hasn’t been changed unexpectedly. If something does change, the hash will be different, alerting you to the issue.
    
Keep Track of Versions
------------------------
  * Each time you save a change (commit), Git creates a new hash. This makes it easy to go back to previous versions of your code whenever you need to.
    
Collaboration Made Easy
------------------------- 
  * When multiple people work on the same project, hashes help keep track of everyone’s changes. This way, Git can merge different contributions without confusion.

Automated Builds
-----------------
  * In software development, teams often use automated systems to build and test their code. These systems use hashes to know exactly which version of the code to work with.

Improving Security
------------------
  * While Git has used SHA-1 for a long time, there are plans to move to a stronger hashing method (SHA-256) for better security against potential attacks.
 
In summary: 
-----------
  * hashing in Git is like giving each change a unique name tag that helps keep everything organized, secure, and easy to track!
